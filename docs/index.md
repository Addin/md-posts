# The Language I'd Learn if I Had to Start Over

## Introduction

In 2006, Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla engineer, set out to create a new programming language.

Inspired by the resilience of the rust fungus â€“ which thrives even in harsh environments â€“ Hoare sought to create a language ready for the toughest challenges in software development (like the age-old tradeoff between performance and safety).

The result was Rust.

I'm an avid C++ developer â€” but if I were starting from scratch today, I would learn Rust.

In fact, I'd urge everyone to learn Rust. I'll explain why.

## Content Overview

I'll run down everything you need to know about Rust, including:

* What makes Rust special: Memory safety & fearless concurrency
* Real-world use cases (+ Fyrox case study)
* How Rust compares to other languages
* 5 steps to learn Rust in 2025

We'll explore in just a second... but first I wanted to remind you that you can access dozens of hands-on Rust courses and projects with an Educative subscription (which you can get at an amazing discount for just a few more days).

Now let's dive in.

## What Makes Rust Special?

![Fearless Concurrency Meme](../assets/img_02.avif)

There's good reason Rust won "Most Admired Programming Language" in Stack Overflow's Developer Surveys for multiple years running.

Rust's standout traits include:

* **Memory safety without garbage collection**: A unique ownership model ensures memory safety and eliminates bugs at compile time.
* **Performance**: Compiles to highly optimized machine code.
* **Fearless concurrency**: Ownership model enables multithreaded programs free from data races.
* **Rich ecosystem**: Various Rust tools make building projects and managing dependencies easier.
* **Beginner-friendly**: Clear error messages help beginners through issues and teach best practices along the way.

To truly understand Rust's edge, we'll unpack three of its pillars: its ownership model for memory safety, fearless concurrency, and how its compiler prevents bugs before runtime.

### Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection

Memory management is one of the most error-prone aspects of programming. Poor memory handling can lead to crashes, vulnerabilities, or inconsistent behavior. But Rust reduces the potential for error with its ownership model, ensuring memory is used safely and efficiently â€” without needing garbage collection.

As a result, Rust eliminates many common bugs at compile time:

* **Null pointer dereferences**: Rust doesn't have null values; it uses the Option type to handle absence.
* **Dangling pointers**: Rust's ownership and borrowing rules ensure references are valid, preventing accessing freed or invalid memory.

### Example: Ownership in Action

In the code snippet below, Rust's borrow checker ensures that data remains valid during use, preventing dangling pointers or unsafe memory access:

```rust
fn main() {
    let data = String::from("Hello, Rust!");
    let length = calculate_length(&data); // Borrowing
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", data, length);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

Output:
```
Task 1 done
Task 2 done
All tasks complete!
```

### Fearless Concurrency and Why It Matters

Fearless concurrency in Rust means writing concurrent programs without the usual headaches.

In many languages, concurrency is a double-edged sword which introduces risks like:

* **Data races**: Simultaneous access and modification of shared data, leading to corruption or crashes.
* **Deadlocks**: Threads stuck waiting for each other, halting the program.
* **Inconsistent states**: Shared data left in an unpredictable or invalid state due to poor synchronization.

Rust eliminates these risks by enforcing safe data access rules at compile time, so you can write performant, multithreaded code that remains safe and predictable.

### Example: Async Programming in Rust

Rust's approach to fearless concurrency extends to asynchronous programming, where tasks run independently without blocking the main program. The tokio crate, a popular library for async programming, helps you manage these tasks efficiently while adhering to Rust's safety guarantees.

In the code snippet below:

* The tokio::join! macro schedules two tasks to run concurrently.
* Rust's ownership model ensures thread safety, preventing data races or invalid references.

```rust
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let task1 = async { sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await; println!("Task 1 done"); };
    let task2 = async { sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await; println!("Task 2 done"); };
    
    tokio::join!(task1, task2);
    println!("All tasks complete!");
}
```

On top of Rust's compile-time guarantees, you can leverage tools like tokio to create multithreaded applications (without common pitfalls).

## Rust's Compilation Model

Rust's compilation process ensures your code runs efficiently and is optimized for your computer's hardware.

Here's a simple breakdown:

1. **Preprocessing**: Expands macros, includes external files, and applies conditional compilation.
2. **Compilation**: Analyzes and transforms your code into machine instructions, performing error checks and optimizations.
3. **Linking**: Combines object files with necessary libraries to create the final executable.

Here's a visual of how Rust's compiler works:

By adding safety checks during compilation, Rust catches most bugs during this compilation process, so you can avoid issues like memory errors before your program even runs.

## Rust in the Real World

Rust thrives in various use cases where safety and performance are paramount:

### Web and Cloud Development
* Rust's speed and safety make it ideal for web services and cloud-native applications.
* Example: Amazon's Lambda platform uses Rust to handle serverless computers with high efficiency.

### Embedded Systems and IoT
* With zero-cost abstractions, Rust excels in environments with tight resource constraints.
* Example: Developers use Rust to build firmware for devices like drones and wearables.

### WebAssembly (Wasm)
* Rust is a top choice for Wasm modules, enabling fast, secure, browser-based applications.
* Example: Figma leverages Rust and WebAssembly for its high-performance design tool.

### AI and Machine Learning
* Rust's safety and performance make it ideal for AI/ML pipelines.
* Example: Hugging Face's Rust-based tokenizers power high-performance NLP tasks.

### Game Development
* Rust's low-level control makes it a powerful alternative to C++.
* Example: Fyrox (we'll discuss below).

Major companies using Rust include Microsoft, Facebook, Dropbox, and Discord.

## Case Study: Fyroxâ€“Build Games Using Rust

Rust's performance, safety, and low-level control make it an increasingly compelling choice for game development for both indie developers and major studios.

A testament to this is Fyrox (formerly RG3D). Fyrox is a Rust-based game engine that balances ease of use with advanced functionalities.

Here's how Rust's features directly power Fyrox's success:

* **Zero-cost abstractions**: Enables real-time 2D and 3D rendering with memory safety, preventing crashes and glitches.
* **Cross-platform capabilities**: Supports Fyrox games for desktops, consoles, and more.
* **Scriptable with Rust**: Ensures type safety and minimizes runtime errors.

Whether you're building a small 2D platformer or a sprawling 3D adventure, Rust and its game engines are well-equipped for high-performance, scalable games.

## Rust vs. Other Languages

Here's how Rust stacks up to C++, Go, and Python:

Unlike Go or Python, which focus on simplicity, Rust empowers you to write low-level, high-performance code that's still safe and maintainable.

Compared to C++, Rust also offers low-level control and performance â€” minus the steep learning curve.
